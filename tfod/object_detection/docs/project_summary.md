### Project Summary: **Object Detection with TensorFlow**

---

#### **Project Title**: Object Detection with TensorFlow API  
**Folder Name**: `Object_detection`  
**Project Goal**:  
To build an object detection system that can recognize everyday objects (e.g., pencil, mouse) in real-time using a camera feed, leveraging TensorFlow's Object Detection API and pre-trained models.

---

### **Key Components**

#### 1. **Objective**:
- Detect and classify objects in a live camera feed or video.
- Draw bounding boxes around detected objects and label them with their names and confidence scores.
- Optionally, train a custom model to detect specific objects not included in the default models.

#### 2. **Dependencies**:
- **TensorFlow**: For running pre-trained object detection models.
- **OpenCV**: For accessing the camera feed and processing video frames.
- **Protobuf**: To compile `.proto` files required by the TensorFlow Object Detection API.
- **NumPy and Matplotlib**: For data processing and visualization.
- **Pillow**: For image manipulation.

#### 3. **System Requirements**:
- Python 3.7 or higher.
- A virtual environment for isolated package management.
- (Optional) GPU setup with CUDA and cuDNN for faster inference.

### **Folder Structure**

#### Root: `Object_detection/`
- **`data/`**: Stores input data like images or videos to be processed.
- **`models/`**: Houses the pre-trained models downloaded from TensorFlow Model Zoo.
- **`scripts/`**: Contains Python scripts for:
  - Setting up the environment.
  - Running object detection on video feeds or images.
  - Training custom models (if required).
- **`output/`**: Contains output images or videos with detected objects annotated.
- **`configs/`**: Stores configuration files for training and model parameters.
- **`notebooks/`**: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis or running test code.
- **`README.md`**: Project overview and instructions.

### **Workflow**

1. **Setup**:
   - Create a virtual environment and install dependencies.
   - Clone the TensorFlow Models repository and set up the Object Detection API.

2. **Model Selection**:
   - Choose a pre-trained model from the TensorFlow Model Zoo (e.g., SSD MobileNet V2 for real-time detection).
   - Download the model and place it in the `models/` directory.

3. **Run Inference**:
   - Use Python scripts to:
     - Load the pre-trained model.
     - Access the live camera feed or process images.
     - Detect objects and annotate frames with bounding boxes and labels.

4. **Optional: Train a Custom Model**:
   - Collect and annotate your dataset for the specific objects you want to detect.
   - Use TensorFlowâ€™s Object Detection API to fine-tune a pre-trained model.

5. **Results**:
   - Save annotated videos/images in the `output/` folder.
   - Visualize results using Jupyter notebooks or Matplotlib.

### **Expected Outcomes**
- A fully functional object detection system that:
  - Detects objects in real-time using a camera.
  - Provides labeled annotations with confidence scores.
  - Is extensible to include new object classes with custom training.

---

### **Future Improvements**
- Optimize for edge devices using TensorFlow Lite.
- Add support for multi-camera setups.
- Implement a web interface for real-time object detection.
