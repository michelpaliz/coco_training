Here’s a breakdown of each path in your `Paths` class and its purpose:

---

### **1. `BASE_DIR`**
- **Definition**: The root directory for all data and model files. In your case, it’s pointing to your USB location.
- **Use**: Acts as the base path for all other subdirectories (e.g., annotations, raw images, processed data, models).

---

### **2. `ANNOTATIONS`**
- **Definition**: `f"{BASE_DIR}/annotations/instances_train2017.json"`
- **Use**: Stores COCO dataset annotations in JSON format. This file contains information about object categories, bounding boxes, and image IDs.
- **When to use**: Used during the **data extraction phase** to load object annotations and metadata via the `pycocotools` library.

---

### **3. `IMAGES_DIR`**
- **Definition**: `f"{BASE_DIR}/train2017/train2017"`
- **Use**: Directory containing raw COCO dataset images. These are the original images referenced in the annotations file.
- **When to use**: Used during the **data extraction phase** to locate and process raw images.

---

### **4. `RAW_DIR`**
- **Definition**: `f"{BASE_DIR}/raw"`
- **Use**: Stores images extracted from the COCO dataset, organized by categories (e.g., mouse, book, keyboard).
- **When to use**: Used during the **data extraction phase** to save cropped images corresponding to bounding boxes in the annotations file.

---

### **5. `PROCESSED_DIR`**
- **Definition**: `f"{BASE_DIR}/processed"`
- **Use**: Parent directory for further processed data (training, validation, resized images).
- **When to use**: Acts as the base for the next three directories: `TRAIN_DIR`, `VAL_DIR`, and `RESIZED_DIR`.

---

### **6. `TRAIN_DIR`**
- **Definition**: `f"{PROCESSED_DIR}/train"`
- **Use**: Stores the processed training images, organized by categories (e.g., mouse, book, keyboard).
- **When to use**: Used during:
  - **Model training**: Load training images and labels.
  - **Class label inference**: Dynamically infer class names for predictions.

---

### **7. `VAL_DIR`**
- **Definition**: `f"{PROCESSED_DIR}/val"`
- **Use**: Stores the processed validation images, organized by categories.
- **When to use**: Used during:
  - **Model validation**: Evaluate model performance after each training epoch.
  - **Hyperparameter tuning**: Monitor loss/accuracy to adjust training parameters.

---

### **8. `RESIZED_DIR`**
- **Definition**: `f"{PROCESSED_DIR}/resized"`
- **Use**: Stores resized images for standardized dimensions (e.g., 128x128). These can either belong to training, validation, or testing sets.
- **When to use**: During the **resizing phase** to ensure all images have uniform dimensions for model input.

---

### **9. `TEST_DIR`**
- **Definition**: `f"{BASE_DIR}/test"`
- **Use**: Stores unseen test images, organized by categories, for evaluating the model’s performance.
- **When to use**: Used during:
  - **Model testing**: Evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
  - **Predictions analysis**: Generate confusion matrices or accuracy metrics.

---

### **10. `MODEL_SAVE_PATH`**
- **Definition**: `f"{BASE_DIR}/models/model.pth"`
- **Use**: Stores the trained model weights.
- **When to use**:
  - **Saving**: Save the model's state dictionary after training.
  - **Loading**: Load the trained model for testing or inference (e.g., camera predictions).
