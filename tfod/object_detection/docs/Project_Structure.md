### **Description of Each Folder**

1. **`data/`**:  
   - Organizes all the data used in the project.  
   - Separate subfolders for raw, training, testing, and annotation files to keep everything structured.

2. **`models/`**:  
   - Keeps models organized.
   - Use the `pretrained/` folder for models downloaded from the TensorFlow Model Zoo.
   - Use the `custom/` folder for any fine-tuned models specific to your project.

3. **`scripts/`**:  
   - Contains core Python scripts for running key operations, such as preprocessing data, training models, detecting objects, and evaluating model performance.

4. **`configs/`**:  
   - Stores configuration files like TensorFlow training pipelines and label maps.

5. **`notebooks/`**:  
   - Use for exploratory tasks, such as visualizing datasets or training/testing interactively.

6. **`output/`**:  
   - Captures the results of your detection tasks (annotated images/videos) and training outputs (e.g., logs).

7. **`tests/`**:  
   - Holds unit tests to ensure your scripts work as expected.

8. **`utils/`**:  
   - Utility scripts for shared functionality, such as dataset manipulation and visualization.

9. **Project Root Files**:
   - **`README.md`**: Write a high-level overview of the project, setup instructions, and usage examples.
   - **`requirements.txt`**: List all required Python dependencies.
   - **`test_dependencies.py`**: Script to check and install missing dependencies.

### Creating the Structure

Run the following commands to create this structure:

```bash
mkdir -p Object_detection/{data/{raw,annotations,train,test},models/{pretrained,custom},scripts,configs,notebooks,output/{images,videos,logs},tests,utils}
touch Object_detection/{README.md,requirements.txt,test_dependencies.py}
```
